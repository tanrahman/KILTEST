N    * and only if ret < len; otherwise, the value in ret tells you
N    * how big to make dst if you decide to reallocate it. (That
N    * value does _not_ include the NUL.)
N    * 
N    * If no NUL is encountered within the first len bytes of dst,
N    * then the length of dst is considered to have been equal to
N    * len for the purposes of the return value (as if there were a
N    * NUL at dst[len]). Thus, the return value in this case is len
N    * + strlen(src).
N    *

N    /*
N     * Copies or moves a piece of memory from one place to another,
N     * with one-bit granularity. So you can start or finish a copy
N     * part way through a byte, and you can copy between regions
N     * with different alignment within a byte.
N     * 
N     * All these functions have the same prototype: two void *
N     * pointers for destination and source, then two integers
N     * giving the bit offset from those pointers, and finally the
N     * number of bits to copy.
N     * 
N     * Just like memcpy and memmove, the "cpy" functions copy as
N     * fast as they can in the assumption that the memory regions
N     * do not overlap, while the "move" functions cope correctly
N     * with overlap.
N     *
N     * Treating memory as a stream of individual bits requires
N     * defining a convention about what order those bits are
N     * considered to be arranged in. The above functions support
N     * multiple conventions:
N     * 
N     *  - the "bl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion, so that the LSB comes
N     *    first. (For example, membitcpybl(a,b,0,7,1) would copy
N     *    the MSB of the byte at b to the LSB of the byte at a.)
N     * 
N     *  - the "bb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    byte, and consider the bits within each byte to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion, so that the MSB comes
N     *    first.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "hb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    16-bit halfword, and consider the bits within each word
N     *    to be arranged in big-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wl" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in little-endian fashion.
N     * 
N     *  - the "wb" functions consider the unit of memory to be the
N     *    32-bit word, and consider the bits within each word to be
N     *    arranged in big-endian fashion.
